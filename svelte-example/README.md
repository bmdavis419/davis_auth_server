# svelte-example

This is an example of a Svelte app that uses the auth server.

## steps

1. `pnpm install`
2. Add your env vars to the `.env` file. See `.env.example` for the correct format.
3. `pnpm run dev`

## notes

- The auth server is running on `http://localhost:8787` by default. If you want to change this, you can change the `AUTH_SERVER_URL` in the `.env` file.
